A few tests run against a neo4j-instance. This instance can be installed and run using following rake commands:
```sh
rake neo4j:install                           # Install Neo4j to the neo4j directory under your project
rake neo4j:start                             # Start Neo4j
rake neo4j:stop                              # Stop Neo4j
```
